# Data Visualization Critique & Redesign

## Business Task
The objective is to improve an existing data visualization. Select an infographic using an accessible database that you believe can be enhanced. Provide a credited screenshot and a source link. In 500 words or less, analyze the original visualization, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses. Then, redesign it using the same dataset, creating both a hand-drawn sketch and a digital data visualization utilizing tools like Excel, Tableau, or PowerBI for data manipulation, alongside other relevant software for finishing touches. This task showcases your ability to enhance data presentation.
