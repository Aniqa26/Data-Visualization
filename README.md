## Data Visualization Critique
The objective involves a critical evaluation of infographics and data visualizations through the examination of existing instances. This entails the selection of a well-crafted and a poorly-executed infographic that have received limited online critique. 500-word concise analyses for each, emphasizing their respective merits and shortcomings.

## Data Visualization Critique & Redesign 
The objective is to improve an existing data visualization. Select an infographic using an accessible database that you believe can be enhanced. Provide a credited screenshot and a source link. In 500 words or less, analyze the original visualization, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses. Then, redesign it using the same dataset, creating both a hand-drawn sketch and a digital data visualization utilizing tools like Excel, Tableau, or PowerBI for data manipulation, alongside other relevant software for finishing touches. This task showcases your ability to enhance data presentation.
